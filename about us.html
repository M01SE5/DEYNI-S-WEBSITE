            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>I am Daniel of Deyni's. I started this business to help my parents and to share my blessing with other people in need. I aim to grow this business not just for myself but for others as well.
			A purposeful business is what I desire, with the Lord as my guide, I believe that if I dedicate this to Him, he will make it succeed.</p>
			
            <p>I discovered the idea of the chocolate covered chips online when i was scrolling throough social media and found a post about "potato barks" .
			Then i got the idea to make it into chips. After taking further research about this product, i found out that prooducts like these already exists. 
			other businesses like "Royce's" and other businesses on shoppee or other online shopping platforms. When i tried comparing my product against the competitor's,
			i figured that my own products can compete and keep up with these other businesses. So i took the liberty to push this idea and share it to my friends, family, and online.</p>
